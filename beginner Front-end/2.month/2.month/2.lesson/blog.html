          Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the
          world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a
          globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet, in
          which there is no center because every point, or none, is center — an
          equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman's earth, if
          free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice, not in
          theory.

          Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both
          good and evil. But there's no turning back from science. The early
          warnings about technological dangers also come from science.

          What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set
          foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.

          A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon
          seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators.
          That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not
          help but love and cherish her.
        </p>
        <p>
          For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and
          perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes
          your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more
          valuable than those which divide us.

          There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both
          figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations.
          And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill
          of just beginning.

          The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of
          tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much
          for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.

          Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or
          even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is
          carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.
        </p>
        <h2>Reaching for the Stars</h2>
        <p>
          As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size.
          Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can
          imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so
          delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and
          fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.

          Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship
          Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to
          seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has
          gone before.
        </p>
        <p>
          As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of
          realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore,
          and this is exploration at its greatest.
